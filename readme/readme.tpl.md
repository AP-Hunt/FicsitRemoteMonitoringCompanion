# Ficsit Remote Monitoring Companion

Ficsit Remote Monitoring Companion (FRMC) is a companion application for the 
[Ficsit Remote Montioring mod](https://ficsit.app/mod/B9bEiZFtaaQZHU) 
for [Satisfactory](https://www.satisfactorygame.com/).

The Ficsit Remote Monitoring mod exports metrics about the loaded save in 
Satisfactory, via a web server serving JSON. This companion application 
provides a visulisation tool on top of those metrics.

## Installation instructions
See [installation instructions](./InstallationInstructions.md)

## How do I use it?
FRMC offers two tools for visualising the data being collected:

1. [The realtime map](http://localhost:8000)*
1. [The Prometheus metrics server](http://localhost:9090)*

The realtime map shows your factory buildings on the Satisfactory game world map, and charts their production levels in the last 5 minutes. 

The [Prometheus mertics server](https://prometheus.io/) allows you to [explore the data being exported](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics) using the full power of Prometheus.

(&#42; Link goes to the address on your local system. If FRMC is not running, you will see an error)

## What metrics are available

<!-- This table is generated by running `Companion.exe -ShowMetrics` -->
__METRICS_TABLE__

## How it works
Ficsit Remote Monitoring Companion reads metric data from the Ficsit Remote Montioring mod, stores it in a local Prometheus instance, and enables to users to visualise it using a realtime map or the Prometheus query interface.

## Building FRMC
To build FRMC, run `make` from the `Companion/` directory. This will download all the necessary dependencies and build FRMC.

## Commit guidlines
Commits should contain a title on the first line, followed by a blank line, followed by as much detail as necessary to undertstand what the commit does and why. Lines should avoid being more than 80 characters wide.

Commit titles prefixed with `feat:`, `fix:` or `improvement:` will appear in the release notes. If a change sensibly spans multiple commits, either use the last commit to add informationt to the release notes, or use en empty commit.

An example of a good commit looks like this

```
Update building data in marker popups on each request

Previously, the map was requesting new data regularly but wasn't
updating the marker contents. This meant that if a building's recipe
changed, it would never be reflected in the map.
