# Ficsit Remote Monitoring Companion installation instructions

## First time

To install the Ficsit Remote Monitoring Companion:
1. Download `FicsitRemoteMonitoringCompanion-v{VERSION}.zip` from the latest release on Github.
2. Extract its contents to a directory.
3. Run `Companion.exe`.

On startup, it may prompt you to allow the following executables to open network connections: `Companion.exe`, `PrometheusExporter.exe`, `prometheus.exe`, `grafana-server.exe`. 
You should say yes to all of these. For information on Ficsit Remote Monitoring Companion works, see the section in the Readme.

## Updating to a later version

If you already have Ficsit Remote Monitoring Companion installed, download the latest version and extract it to the same directory. Doing so will preserve any custom dashboards you've created.

If you don't have any custom dashboards configured, you can delete the old version and follow the first time instructions.
